# Ball Python FAQ
Ball Pythons, or Royal Pythons, (_python regius_) are a species of python found in West Africa. The distribution in Africa for these pythons include a range of tropical environments. Their gentle temperament makes these snakes popular and rewarding pets.

## Temperature Requirements
Ball pythons should not be kept below 75°F (24°C) or above 90°F (32°C). Daytime temperatures should have a basking spot approximately 88°F (31°C) with a temperature gradient as low as 80°F (27°C). Temperatures at night should be allowed to fall as low as 75°F (24°C). Some keepers and breeders offer no nighttime temperature drop at all. For the welfare of the animal the recommended range is **above 75°F (24°C) and below 90°F (32°C)**.

## Humidity Requirements
Humidity is critical for animal welfare and should be frequently monitored and maintained. Digital hygrometers with high/low functions are easy to source and inexpensive.

Ball pythons can tolerate a large range of humidity but do best at **50-60% relative humidity**. A lack of humidity can cause the animal to be more susceptible to disease and dehydration. Too much humidity can lead to standing water and an overall wet environment that can cause additional health concerns.

Humidity is critical to shedding: too little humidity can lead to stuck shed while too much humidity can lead to shed that tears and the snake will struggle to completely remove it.

## Do Ball Pythons Climb?
Ball pythons will easily climb over the side of an unsecured aquarium. They can navigate a height gradient (stacks of rocks, branches, etc). Both in captivity and in the wild these snakes have been observed off of the ground. This type of enrichment can be beneficial to the animal and rewarding to watch for the keeper.

Other than trees ball pythons have been found in the large termite mounds of Africa, burrows below the corn fields humans have established there, and in natural structures created by tree roots and other foliage. The variety of places these snakes call home in the wild is quite large!

Some animals, especially larger ones or animals that may feel insecure, are often found in burrows both in the wild and in captivity. It has been observed that the smaller male ball python exhibits climbing activities more often than the larger female.

It is beneficial for both the keeper and the pythons to observe captive and wild python behaviors. Animals in general, including pythons, exhibit a variety of individual behaviors. Enrichment in their environment can be enjoyable for your python as well as for people viewing your amazing animal!

## Should You Cohabitate Ball Pythons?
Cohabitating, or keeping several ball pythons in the same enclosure, is suggested only during breeding. Cohabitation can open the doors to disease and stress that may harm the animals being kept.

Ball pythons in the wild are not usually found in _dens_, or large groups, like some other species of snakes. They do not depend on each other or other species to thrive (with the obvious exception of mating). While ball pythons generally do not hurt each other when cohabitated you may find that males may fight and females will push each other away from resources like heat.

It is recommended that you do not cohabitate ball pythons.

## What Is In A Ball Python's Diet?
Ball pythons in the wild have been known to eat local mammals, including bats and rodents, as well as birds.

Many keepers stick to the tried-and-true method of rodents. You may feed mice to smaller animals but it is beneficial (and cost effective!) to switch to rats when you can. This formula works well for the animals. These types of prey items are easy to source and relatively inexpensive for keepers - both new and experienced. With any food item the keeper should be aware of the overall body condition of the animal to avoid dietary problems like obesity.

Some keepers prefer to supplement a rodent diet with guinea fowl or quail. Chicks can be used, however, they should be avoided as most chicks that you can source as food items are high in fat and low in calcium. Whole items should be offered. Prey item parts, like drumsticks from adult chickens, are best avoided but have been used by keepers.

It is not necessary to source exotic food items like African Soft-Furred Rats (also known as _ASFs_, _mastomys_, or _multimammate mice_).

## Feeding A Ball Python
Food items should be slightly larger than the thickest part of the snake.

It is recommended to use feeding tongs or large handled hemostats. Feeding "by hand" is discouraged.

## Can a Ball Python Hurt You?
All animals can bite. Snakes, including ball pythons, can have a violent and painful bite. It is unlikely a ball python will be able to hurt you by constricting or crushing you.

If you are bitten, and if possible, simply wait for the animal to let go. If the animal is constricting always begin unwrapping by the tail first.

## Do Ball Pythons Carry Diseases?
Ball pythons, like any animal, naturally carry a variety of bacteria and other organisms capable of causing disease in ball pythons and other animals. You should wash your hands before and after handling any animal. If you have several animals you should wash your hands between handling different animals. Enclosures should be kept clean. Waste (including uneaten rodents) should be disposed of appropriately.

Locating a vet for your new pet in case of any illness is absolutely mandatory. Veterinarians are trained and capable of performing tasks like culturing bacteria and identifying parasites. Suggestions from experienced keepers and breeders are great but do not replace veterinary care.
